lyrics: |-
  We had it so good
  Always finding ways to be misunderstood 
  The adolescent guns just go undone
  Ready to explode one by one

  Biking on the 59th street bridge against the wind
  The clearing is calling, I’m ready to begin
  Feel like a mason jar just twisted wrong
  I’ve been holding on for way too long

  Waves always calmed me down
  Except when they’re flowing all around town
  Take my hand you’ll be my second son
  We’ll stay together on the run

  Biking on the 59th street bridge against the wind
  The clearing is calling, I’m ready to begin
  Feel like a mason jar just twisted wrong
  I’ve been holding on for way too long

  Silence was so loud 
  Something to fall back on, never was allowed
  Second line saved me from the abyss
  I brought my sticks with me ever since

  Biking on the 59th street bridge against the wind
  The clearing is calling, I’m ready to begin
  Feel like a mason jar just twisted wrong
  I’ve been holding on for way too long

  Biking on the 59th street bridge against the wind
  The clearing is calling, I’m ready to begin
  Feel like a mason jar just twisted wrong
  I’ve been holding on for way too long

It's always a pleasure to work with Thought Police. There's no way I was going to turn turn down the opportunity to be in the studio with these guys and help get their music out to the people.
