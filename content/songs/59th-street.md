lyrics: |-
  We had it so good <br />
  Always finding ways to be misunderstood <br />
  The adolescent guns just go undone <br />
  Ready to explode one by one <br />

  Biking on the 59th street bridge against the wind <br />
  The clearing is calling, I’m ready to begin <br />
  Feel like a mason jar just twisted wrong <br />
  I’ve been holding on for way too long <br />

  Waves always calmed me down <br />
  Except when they’re flowing all around town <br />
  Take my hand you’ll be my second son <br />
  We’ll stay together on the run <br />

  Biking on the 59th street bridge against the wind <br />
  The clearing is calling, I’m ready to begin <br />
  Feel like a mason jar just twisted wrong <br />
  I’ve been holding on for way too long <br />

  Silence was so loud <br />
  Something to fall back on, never was allowed <br />
  Second line saved me from the abyss <br />
  I brought my sticks with me ever since <br />

  Biking on the 59th street bridge against the wind <br />
  The clearing is calling, I’m ready to begin <br />
  Feel like a mason jar just twisted wrong <br />
  I’ve been holding on for way too long <br />

  Biking on the 59th street bridge against the wind <br />
  The clearing is calling, I’m ready to begin <br />
  Feel like a mason jar just twisted wrong <br />
  I’ve been holding on for way too long <br />

It's always a pleasure to work with Thought Police. There's no way I was going to turn turn down the opportunity to be in the studio with these guys and help get their music out to the people.
