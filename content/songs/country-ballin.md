My good friend Vinnie suggested one day that I should create a country rap beat. I said, "sure, why not?" After layering some 808s with a little acoustic guitar and hammond organ, I figured I might as well write some lyrics and lay down a vocal part on top of it.

Iï»¿ wove together several stereotypes and tropes from both country and rap genres to form the slightly obnoxious and unabashedly generic lyrics you hear today. I had fun making this song and hope that people don't take it too seriously and enjoy listening.
