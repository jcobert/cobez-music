lyrics: |-
  I got the radio on

  The beats keep knockin’

  Always on the grind

  There ain’t no stoppin’

  Got them ladies in the pickup    

  With the bands and the racks

  Yeah, I’m all about that hustle

  I ain’t ever goin’ back

  I be ballin’ every day

  Whippin’ trucks and Ferraris

  Let them haters hate

  You know I ain’t sorry

  Got the country boy swag

  That keep 'em all callin'  

  Yeah, I’m country ballin’



  Cruisin’ down the backroads in my Lambo’

  I be slinging moonshine for my cash flow

  Louis V and Yves Saint got me lookin’ fly

  Out here livin’ life just like it’s do or die

  I wanna see the way you move it to your favorite song 

  Underneath the stars at night out on the lawn

  SoCo and lime got me feelin’ right

  We livin’ life like it’s our last night



  I got the radio on

  The beats keep knockin’

  Always on the grind

  There ain’t no stoppin’

  Got them ladies in the pickup    

  With the bands and the racks

  Yeah, I’m all about that hustle

  I ain’t ever goin’ back

  I be ballin’ every day

  Whippin’ trucks and Ferraris

  Let them haters hate

  You know I ain’t sorry

  Got the country boy swag

  That keep 'em all callin'  

  Yeah, I’m country ballin’



  I got my Jordans for the club and the boots for the ranch

  I like them ladies with a tiny waist and a farmer’s tan

  Turn on the country charm, candlelit on the farm

  I win her over then I show her what it’s like to roll with me  

  The Silverado or the Bentley, yeah I’m livin’ large

  Pockets fat I’m always payin’ cash, yeah I never charge 

  When I’m down by the lake

  In every chance that I take

  With all the shots that I’m callin’

  You know I’m country ballin’



  I got the radio on

  The beats keep knockin’

  Always on the grind

  There ain’t no stoppin’

  Got them ladies in the pickup    

  With the bands and the racks

  Yeah, I’m all about that hustle

  I ain’t ever goin’ back

  I be ballin’ every day

  Whippin’ trucks and Ferraris

  Let them haters hate

  You know I ain’t sorry

  Got the country boy swag

  That keep 'em all callin'  

  Yeah, I’m country ballin’



  I got the radio on

  The beats keep knockin’

  Always on the grind

  There ain’t no stoppin’

  Got them ladies in the pickup    

  With the bands and the racks

  Yeah, I’m all about that hustle

  I ain’t ever goin’ back

  I be ballin’ every day

  Whippin’ trucks and Ferraris

  Let them haters hate

  You know I ain’t sorry

  Got the country boy swag

  That keep 'em all callin'  

  Yeah, I’m country ballin’



  Got the country boy swag

  That keep 'em all callin'  

  Yeah, I’m country ballin’

My good friend Vinnie suggested one day that I should create a country rap beat. I said, "sure, why not?" After layering some 808s with a little acoustic guitar and Hammond organ, I figured I might as well write some lyrics and lay down a vocal part on top of it.

I﻿ wove together several stereotypes and tropes from both country and rap genres to form the slightly obnoxious and unabashedly generic lyrics you hear today. I had fun making this song and hope that people don't take it too seriously and enjoy listening.
