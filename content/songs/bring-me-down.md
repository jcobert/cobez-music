lyrics: |
  When we met on that summer night
  Everything about us felt so right
  Just you and me and the ocean breeze
  I wish I could only see it then

  My love was yours for the taking
  But you’re a heartbreak in the making
  You never treated me with the respect that I deserve

  I thought you were the one 
  My heart beat like a drum
  I went and took the plunge
  But you never seemed to meet me in the water

  I can see the man behind the man
  I’m stronger than you think I am
  Without you
  It’s time for me to move on now

  Today I'm gonna take a stand
  Time for me to find another man
  'Cause you're only gonna make me cry
  And I won't let that happen one more time

  Every time I hear the sound
  Of your voice I wanna turn around
  And walk away, walk away 
  'Cause nothing's gonna bring me down

  Every time you played with my emotions
  In my heart there were explosions
  Now it feels like I am sleeping
  Even though I’m wide awake

  I always gave you everything you want
  I was thinking where did I go wrong
  But all along it was you, not me
  You won’t get off that easily 

  I thought you were the one 
  My heart beat like a drum
  I went and took the plunge
  But you never seemed to meet me in the water

  I can see the man behind the man
  I’m stronger than you think I am
  Without you
  It’s time for me to move on now

  Today I'm gonna take a stand
  Time for me to find another man
  'Cause you're only gonna make me cry
  And I won't let that happen one more time

  Every time I hear the sound
  Of your voice I wanna turn around
  And walk away, walk away 
  'Cause nothing's gonna bring me down

  I feel like I’m chasing you in circles
  Trying to find a way
  For you and me to work

  Back then I was blind and naive
  But now I see
  That you and me were never meant to be

  Today I'm gonna take a stand
  Time for me to find another man
  'Cause you're only gonna make me cry
  And I won't let that happen one more time

  Every time I hear the sound
  Of your voice I wanna turn around
  And walk away, walk away 
  'Cause nothing's gonna bring me down

I﻿ wrote this song for a female singer, but had no particular artist in mind at the time. I knew it needed someone with range and emotion, which is when I thought of Steph. She was on board right away when I asked her if she wanted to be the artist for this track, and was a pleasure to work with.

W﻿e collaborated during the 2020 pandemic so we worked remotely and it worked out surprisingly well. Steph had a recording setup at her home and she was incredibly receptive to my guidance and feedback. There was minimal back and forth, as she delivered each vocal take I was looking for. I look forward to collaborating with Steph in the future.
