I﻿ wrote this song for a female singer, but had no particular artist in mind at the time. I knew it needed someone with range and emotion, which is when I thought of Steph. She was on board right away when I asked her if she wanted to be the artist for this track, and was a pleasure to work with.

W﻿e collaborated during the 2020 pandemic so we worked remotely and it worked out surprisingly well. Steph had a recording setup at her home and she was incredibly receptive to my guidance and feedback. There was minimal back and forth, as she delivered each vocal take I was looking for. I look forward to collaborating with Steph in the future.
