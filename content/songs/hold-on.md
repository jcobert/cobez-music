lyrics: |-
  You keep on longing for the good times
  That have come and gone
  Seeing life through teary eyes
  It's hard just to hold on

  If you think you’re fine, you're wasting time 
  You've got it down all wrong 
  And then you'll see 
  When it finally comes undone 
  The light shines through it all
  I hear you say

  I can't hold on
  The tide is strong
  It won't be long before
  I drift away 

  But you gotta hold on
  You gotta hold on
  When you feel like crying, just keep on trying
  And you’ll make it to the end
  Hold on 

  No one said that life would be easy
  And things will always go your way
  You gotta roll with the punches
  And keep on moving every day 

  When the times get tough, I know it's rough
  But you gotta keep the hope alive
  And you'll get through
  You can do it, just trust yourself
  With the power that you have inside
  I hear you say

  I can't hold on
  The tide is strong
  It won't be long before
  I drift away 

  But you gotta hold on
  You gotta hold on (you gotta hold on, you gotta hold on)
  When you feel like crying, just keep on trying
  And you’ll make it to the end (I’m telling you to)
  Hold on (hold on, hold on)

I﻿ wrote this song during the pandemic that we are all too familiar with. It was a serious struggle for many of us and I felt compelled to write this song. I hope it resonates with some people and that even a few can find comfort in listening to it.
