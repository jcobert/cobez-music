lyrics: |-
  Will you come away with me
  Running from 
  Running far away
  Maybe we can be
  Somebody tonight 
  I stand there looking towards
  Waiting for
  The night to come to life
  I wanna show you everything
  Beyond the world

  Tonight
  You'll come away with me
  And we'll become
  A light 
  To guide us all the way
  Yeah, we'll come alive

  I see you standing there but I don’t know what I would say
  It's just so loud in here I wouldn’t hear you anyway
  I fold the cards I’m dealt then turn around and walk away
  But still I feel I might regret this any other day
  I’m tired of thinking 'bout all of things I didn’t do
  It’s time for me to suck it up and finally see it through 
  I throw one back and then proceed to walk right up to you
  I can’t help but thinking that… 

  Tonight
  You'll come away with me
  And we'll become
  A light 
  To guide us
  To guide us
  All the way
  If tomorrow comes
  And I don't take you home 
  Then on another night
  Yeah, we’ll come alive

  I finally think I've found a way
  In other words I found the words to say
  I’ll start by asking for your name
  Hoping that, that you will ask the same
  The way you look I can’t describe
  It makes me feel like I’m complete inside
  I have to make this happen
  Before tomorrow
  Cause I know… 

  Tonight
  You'll come away with me
  And we'll become
  A light 
  To guide us
  To guide us
  All the way
  If tomorrow comes
  And I don't take you home 
  Then on another night
  Yeah, we’ll come alive
