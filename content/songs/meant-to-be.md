description: A basic love ballad.
lyrics: |-
  You come to me
  But I don't wanna see
  What you think about
  The way it used to be
  Where did you go
  When I thought we could be bigger than
  A flicker of hope that you and me are more than friends
  Maybe one day
  You'll finally come around

  I refuse to be the one who ends up broken
  But I know you'll never see
  That we are meant to be

  Thinking about the times we had
  It makes smile and I am glad
  That I got to make those memories with you
  I won't let you go
  Even if another comes around
  I think about you and me
  And I really like the sound of it
  I can only hope
  You will finally see

  I refuse to be the one who ends up broken
  But I know you'll never see
  That we are meant to be
  Ooh

  Even after all those times we had 
  I can't help but think this might end bad 
  But I hope and pray to God it isn't true 
  Without you I'm alone inside 
  It was always you that clarified 
  All my thoughts that end up floating back to you 

  I refuse to be the one who ends up broken
  But I know you'll never see
  That we are meant to be

  That we are meant to be
  (we are, we are, we are)
  That we are meant to be
  (we are, we are, we are)
  That we are meant to be
