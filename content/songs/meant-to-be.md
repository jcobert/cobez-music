lyrics: |-
  You come to me but I don't wanna see

  What you think about the way it used to be

  Where did you go

  When I thought we could be bigger than

  A flicker of hope that you and me are more than friends

  Maybe one day you'll finally come around



  I refuse to be the one who ends up broken

  But I know you'll never see

  That we are meant to be



  Thinking about the times we had

  It makes me smile and I am glad

  That I got to make those memories with you

  I won't let you go

  Even if another comes around

  I think about you and me

  And I really like the sound of it

  I can only hope you will finally see



  I refuse to be the one who ends up broken

  But I know you'll never see

  That we are meant to be

  Oooh



  Even after all those times we had 

  I can't help but think this might end bad 

  But I hope and pray to God it isn't true 

  Without you I'm alone inside 

  It was always you that clarified 

  All my thoughts that end up floating back to you 



  I refuse to be the one who ends up broken

  But I know you'll never see

  That we are meant to be



  That we are meant to be

  (we are, we are, we are)

  That we are meant to be

  (we are, we are, we are)

  That we are meant to be
