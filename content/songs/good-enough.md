description: Here's a pop song about not settling for less than you deserve.
lyrics: |-
  When I wake up in the morning
  And I'm feeling kinda lonely
  I wonder why you're not here with me
  Cause I can be your one and only
  I don't know what it is about you
  But I see the things that we can be
  And I do know just one thing for sure
  You'll never find a guy like me

  You know I'll ride or die for you
  In every single thing I do 
  I wanna be your everything
  I don't wanna be good enough
  Good enough
  In time I hope that you will see
  That you and I are meant to be
  I wanna be your everything
  I don't wanna be good enough
  Good enough

  Why you always make me wait up
  It makes me think that I don’t mean much to you
  You always find a way to make me believe
  That you really want to be with me
  I don’t wanna be a distant memory
  And make me put away my dignity
  You can run with me far away
  Away

  You know I'll ride or die for you
  In every single thing I do 
  I wanna be your everything
  I don't wanna be good enough
  Good enough
  In time I hope that you will see
  That you and I are meant to be
  I wanna be your everything
  I don't wanna be good enough
  Good enough

  Good enough, good enough
  Good enough, good enough
  Good enough, good enough
  Good enough, good enough
  (Oooh)

  You know I'll ride or die for you
  In every single thing I do 
  I wanna be your everything
  I don't wanna be good enough
  Good enough
  In time I hope that you will see
  That you and I are meant to be
  I wanna be your everything
  I don't wanna be good enough
  Good enough
