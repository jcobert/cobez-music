lyrics: |-
  Between where I end and where you begin
  There’s a void I feel I’m falling in
  And I wonder when you’re gonna pull me out (ooh)
  You caught my eye but didn't catch my heart
  I should’ve known right from the start
  That it takes time to really know just what to do (ooh)

  You know we’re meant to be
  I hope you can see
  That you're made for me
  And I'm the one that fits your missing piece (ooh)
  Why we're not together’s a mystery
  Cause you and I are meant to be
  And I wonder when you'll finally see the truth
  I keep running back to you 

  I keep running back to you

  Something tells me I'm a fool for thinking
  The thoughts of you that keep me drinking
  I know that if I could only have a chance (ooh)
  My mind is racing. The time is wasting
  How do I leave this hole I'm placed in
  Can we just give it a shot in the hopes that we can be (ooh)

  You know we’re meant to be
  I hope you can see
  That you're made for me
  And I'm the one that fits your missing piece (ooh)
  Why we're not together’s a mystery
  Cause you and I are meant to be
  And I wonder when you'll finally see the truth
  I keep running back to you

  I keep running back to you
