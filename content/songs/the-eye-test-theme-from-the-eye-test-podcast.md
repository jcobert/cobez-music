lyrics: |-
  This is The Eye Test
  You know we better than the rest
  We keep it real
  We never lyin’
  From the gridiron to diamond
  Talkin’ Mets, Jets, ’n’ bets
  It’s The Eye Test

  Yeah, we’ll play a lil’ Monday mornin’ QB
  Who we pickin’ for tonight
  You’ll just have to wait and see
  We got the covers 
  Over/unders
  And the fumblers and runners
  All you need is right here
  The Eye Test is where to be

  This is The Eye Test
  You know we better than the rest
  We keep it real
  We never lyin’
  From the gridiron to diamond
  Talkin’ Mets, Jets, ’n’ bets
  It’s The Eye Test
  This is The Eye Test
  You know we better than the rest
  We keep it real
  We never lyin’
  From the gridiron to diamond
  Talkin’ Mets, Jets, ’n’ bets
  It’s The Eye Test

  He don’t have a degree in optometry
  But, he calls it like he sees it
  It’s my man B.D. yeah
  You tunin’ in to the host with the most
  Analysis and predictions
  From the pregame to post
  20/20 vision when we lookin’ at the game
  Follow us and make that money
  Yeah, there’s nothin’ to explain
  We cookin’ up parlays like Betty Crocker
  Yeah, the takes may be hot
  But, this podcast is hotter

  This is The Eye Test
  You know we better than the rest
  We keep it real
  We never lyin’
  From the gridiron to diamond
  Talkin’ Mets, Jets, ’n’ bets
  It’s The Eye Test
  This is The Eye Test
  You know we better than the rest
  We keep it real
  We never lyin’
  From the gridiron to diamond
  Talkin’ Mets, Jets, ’n’ bets
  It’s The Eye Test

  It’s The Eye Test
  Yeah, we better than the rest (rest)
  It’s The Eye Test
  You know we better than the rest (rest)
  It’s The Eye Test
  Its, it’s The Eye Test
  You know we better than the rest
  Better, better than the
  Better than the rest

The Eye Test is a sports podcast, hosted by my good friend Brian Donovan. I currently produce the show - editing the episodes and prepping them for release. This song is the extended version of the intro theme music that I created for the show.
