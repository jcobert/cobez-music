lyrics: |-
  No I don’t forgive you 

  In fact I only hate you more

  With every day that passes by 

  I’m closer to the door 



  The stories always changing

  You slip up and I learn more

  I’m already down, stop kicking

  What was all this for 



  It was the death of a relationship 

  Both a lover and a friend 

  Convinced myself that it was worth it 

  But it wasn’t in the end 



  And I’ll never know the full truth 

  Know just what I need to know 

  All I know for certain 

  Is that I should’ve let you go 

  \
  I just thought that you were different

  We were seeing eye to eye

  Thought you felt it just as much as me

  The day we fell from the sky 



  But you ruined all of the magic 

  Now your face just makes me sick 

  So sad to think I lost a friend 

  For a love that didn’t stick



  It was the death of a relationship 

  Both a lover and a friend 

  Convinced myself that it was worth it 

  But it wasn’t in the end 



  And I’ll never know the full truth

  Know just what I need to know

  All I know for certain

  Is that I should’ve let you go



  And you absolutely changed my life 

  Just wasn’t for the better 

  Ruined a love that’s loved in lives before

  Cause you didn’t wanna upset her 



  It was the death of a relationship 

  Both a lover and a friend 

  Convinced myself that it was worth it 

  But it wasn’t in the end 



  And I’ll never know the full truth 

  Know just what I need to know 

  All I know for certain 

  Is that I should’ve let you go

When Steph came to me with this song she had written, I was excited to help bring her vision to life.
