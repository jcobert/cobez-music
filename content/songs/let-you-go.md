lyrics: |-
  No, I don’t forgive you
  In fact I only hate you more
  With every day that passes by
  I’m closer to the door

  The story's always changing
  You slip up and I learn more
  I’m already down, stop kicking
  What was all this for?

  It was the death of a relationship
  Both a lover and a friend
  Convinced myself that it was worth it
  But it wasn’t in the end

  And I’ll never know the full truth
  Know just what I need to know
  All I know for certain
  Is that I should’ve let you go

  I just thought that you were different
  We were seeing eye to eye
  Thought you felt it just as much as me
  The day we fell from the sky

  But you ruined all of the magic
  Now your face just makes me sick
  So sad to think I lost a friend
  For a love that couldn't stick

  It was the death of a relationship
  Both a lover and a friend
  Convinced myself that it was worth it
  But it wasn’t in the end

  And I’ll never know the full truth
  Know just what I need to know
  All I know for certain
  Is that I should’ve let you go

  And you absolutely changed my life 
  Just wasn’t for the better 
  Ruined a love that’s loved in lives before
  'Cause you didn’t wanna upset her 

  It was the death of a relationship
  Both a lover and a friend
  Convinced myself that it was worth it
  But it wasn’t in the end

  And I’ll never know the full truth
  Know just what I need to know
  All I know for certain
  Is that I should’ve let you go

  Yeah, I should've let you go
  Yeah, I should've let you go
  Mmhmm

  And you absolutely changed my life 
  Just wasn’t for the better 
  Ruined a love that’s loved in lives before
  'Cause you didn’t wanna upset her
