lyrics: |-
  When you’re laying alone at night
  You know I’m just a call away
  I’ll send you on a flight tomorrow
  But this time you’ll be here to stay
  You're in another hemisphere 
  But it feels like you’re still here with me
  No distance is too far for us
  Our love keeps us connected
  It’s plain to see

  You speak a different language
  So let your body do the talking
  I wanna run away with you
  But we'll just start by walking
  I know it might be difficult 
  But I know we can give it a whirl
  My foreign girl

  You speak a different language
  So let your body do the talking
  I wanna run away with you
  But we'll just start by walking
  I know it might be difficult 
  But I know we can give it a whirl
  My foreign girl

  You're in another hemisphere 
  But it feels like you’re still here with me
  No distance is too far for us
  Our love keeps us connected
  It’s plain to see

  You speak a different language
  So let your body do the talking
  I wanna run away with you
  But we'll just start by walking
  I know it might be difficult 
  But I know we can give it a whirl
  My foreign girl

  My foreign girl
  You speak a different language
  So let your body do the talking
  I wanna run away with you
  But we'll just start by walking
  I know it might be difficult 
  But I know we can give it a whirl
  My foreign girl

I﻿ was inspired to write this song by my wife, who was my girlfriend at the time. She did not know she had inspired me, but I was inspired nonetheless, and wrote this song about her. It's a simple tune with a repeated verse, but I think it's pretty catchy.
