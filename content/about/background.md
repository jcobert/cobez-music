I grew up in New York on a hearty serving of classic rock and was exposed to music early on. I've been greatly influenced and inspired by my father who is an acclaimed musician, producer, and engineer (with several Grammy nominations, if I may toot his horn).  

Through watching him, I learned the ropes of production and songwriting, and have continued to carve a path for myself as a musician. From pop and country to film and game scores, I see no bounds when it comes to writing music. 

 I try to create music that people will love and that transcends any preference in genre. I want my passion for music to carry over to those who listen and hope that someday I can be an influence to others.
