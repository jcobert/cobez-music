#### My Music

I have released several singles out to the airwaves as a solo artist, as well as written instrumental pieces, sound to picture, and songs that I'm still looking for the right artist to take on. In addition to my solo work, I've had the pleasure of working with such artists as Thought Police, Steph Taibi, and Bliss Ü, in various capacities such as producer, engineer, songwriter, and vocalist. I enjoy the minutia of mixing a track as much as I do crafting lyrics and melodies, and am always willing to collaborate and get involved in good music however I can contribute.

I﻿t's too difficult to identify everyone who has influenced my music (either directly or by providing creative inspiration), but here are a few I feel have done just that: 

* S﻿teely Dan - Killer songwriting. One of my favorite groups.
* Zedd - One of the best at electronic production. Always crisp percussion and captivating melodies.
* Dispatch - The vibe and vocal harmonies from these guys never disappoint.
* Keanu Reeves - Speed was my favorite movie as a child.

I would also like to mention the illustrious [Marc Blatte](https://marcblatte.com/) who has been a mentor to me and my songwriting. He's built an incredible career as a songwriter and has really challenged me to grow and refine my approach to the musical process.
